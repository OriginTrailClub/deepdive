# Introduction

OriginTrail is an **open protocol** that blends the power of **blockchain** technology and **knowledge graphs** to revolutionize the way **data** is managed, stored, and utilized in **Artificial Intelligence** and other applications.

In other words, it is the combination of two technologies:

1. **Knowledge Graphs** – which are advanced databases used by big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Uber to derive value from user data.
2. **Blockchain** – which enables decentralization, meaning the database is not controlled by for-profit companies.

{% hint style="success" %}
**This combination creates a decentralized database which will serve as the backbone for an open, neutral and transparent application of Artificial Intelligence in every aspect of our lives.**

> **“OriginTrail is going to continue to rise because the Decentralized Knowledge Graph will give AI more and more data.”**
>
> **“The weakness of OriginTrail is that it’s too complicated to explain to ordinary mortals. The technology appears a bit like middleware, which is a category that only tends to excite a handful of people, and I’m one of them.”**
>
> **"The decentralized knowledge graphs will make possible a kind of eternal springtime for artificial intelligence."**
>
> **"AI was invented in about 1968, when I was a graduate student. And for years, AI would rise and then it would fall, and it fell because AI ran out of data."**

> **"Well, it's not going to fall, it's going to continue to rise, because the decentralized knowledge graphs are going to give AI more and more data."** [**source**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ethernet-creator-metcalfe-web3-will-have-all-kinds-of-network-effects/)

## Data and Artificial Intelligence

{% hint style="info" %}
**Metcalfe's Law** states that the **value of a network** grows exponentially with the **number of its users**. This implies that **connectivity** is the real source of value in a network.
{% endhint %}

In other words, **Data** becomes exponentially more valuable when it's connected. Currently, a limited number of corporations control the majority of data, leaving those who are wary of sharing their data due to **trust concerns** with less valuable data. **The Decentralized Knowledge Graph eliminates this trust barrier** by creating an open, transparent network that enables all individuals to share and connect their data while maintaining ownership of their data.

The DKG becomes the provider of limitless data where all Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Google's Bard, Microsoft's ChatGPT and Claude, can be linked together and built upon, resulting in a more transparent, interconnected and valuable ecosystem.

{% hint style="success" %}
**The Decentralized Knowledge Graph is the portal of humanity's data to the Semantic Web and Artificial Intelligence. In other words, the core team of OriginTrail is building the decentralized **<mark style="color:blue;">**Google for Web3**</mark>** and the **<mark style="color:blue;">**Brain of AI**</mark>**.**
