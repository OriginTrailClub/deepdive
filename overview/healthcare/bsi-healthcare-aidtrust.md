# BSI Healthcare – AidTrust

Courtney Solsby from BSI presented a case study on AidTrust, a collaboration between BSI and OriginTrail, focusing on improving access to medicines in developing countries. This initiative addresses the economic implications of the pharmaceutical supply chain, emphasizing sustainability and the significant role of financial investments. AidTrust aims to digitize the supply chain to ensure medicines reach patients in low and middle-income countries efficiently, tackling issues like counterfeit drugs and supply chain complexities. Utilizing OriginTrail's decentralized knowledge graph, AidTrust offers traceability from the manufacturer to the patient, enhancing visibility and accountability. This system not only helps in ensuring that donated medicines reach the intended beneficiaries but also supports pharmaceutical companies in demonstrating their sustainability efforts to investors. The collaboration highlights the transformational potential of leveraging digital technology and blockchain for greater transparency, trust, and efficiency in global healthcare supply chains.

> "Our Healthcare sector team is working closely with our strategic partner - Trace Labs - to offer the end to end data management, through a decentralized knowledge graph - allowing all supply chain systems (audit management, diversion, track and trace, product traceability, planning and logistics operations) to be linked into one data management hub - for dashboard macro views.

> We have FINALLY worked out a neutral way to link all internal supply chain systems to drive data, analytics, and ultimately, visibility."

Together with the British Standards Institution (BSI), Trace Labs, the core developers of the [OriginTrail](https://origintrail.io/), has launched AidTrust to bring trust, transparency, and reliability to the global pharmaceutical industry. Using the OriginTrail DKG and industry best practice, AidTrust ensures end-to-end traceability for donated medicines and vaccines whilst retaining data integrity and security.

“BSI, supported by strategic partner TraceLabs, implemented a data management hub based on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and underlying blockchains, powering a solution that enables product authentication, tracks patient utilization, and highlights any diversion or waste issues.” This case study is currently underway in India.

There are currently two global pharmaceutical companies and one NGO participating in the case study utilizing the BSI / Trace labs joint solution (see case study link above). Community member guinnessstache managed to TRAC down one of the big Pharma currently using the ODN.
