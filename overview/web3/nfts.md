# NFTs & Knowledge Assets

NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent ownership of a wide range of assets, from collectibles to virtual real estate. However, NFTs face challenges in verifying original ownership and preventing unauthorized copies, complicating intellectual property and copyright enforcement. Moreover, their centralization on specific blockchain networks exacerbates accessibility issues, as participation requires familiarity and access to these particular chains, limiting wider adoption and engagement. This centralization also raises concerns about the resilience and interoperability of NFTs across different blockchain ecosystems, potentially hindering their long-term viability and inclusivity.

A Knowledge Asset represents an evolution in the NFT space, which seeks to address the current limitations of NFTs. It is structured as a dynamic and innovative resource anchored by NFT-backed ownership, ensuring verifiable authenticity through blockchain immutability proofs. Each knowledge asset has a Unique Asset Locator (UAL) for easy discovery, is organized in an AI-friendly Asset Graph (RDF), and can connect with other assets within the DKG, enhancing interconnectivity and utility. The diagram below underscores the Knowledge Asset's layered composition, highlighting its organized structure that combines ownership, verification, and discoverability.

A knowledge asset is essentially a NFT 2.0 which can be created, transferred and updated over time. The DKG enhances the protection and value of NFTs by providing a secure and transparent platform for the tracking and verification of NFT ownership and provenance, a complete history of an NFT, including details such as previous owners, creation date, and any relevant events. This information can add value to NFTs by providing a more complete picture of their history and authenticity, making them more attractive to buyers.
