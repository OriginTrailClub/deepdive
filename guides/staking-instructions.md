# Staking Instructions

{% hint style="info" %}
Starting February 14, 2024, delegated staking will go live on Gnosis mainnet. Delegated staking on NeuroWebAI (formerly known as OriginTrail Parachain) will go live at a later date.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Step 1 - Add Gnosis Network to MetaMask

Begin by adding the Gnosis network to your Metamask extension by either connecting MetaMask to this [**link** ](https://chainlist.org/?search=gnosis)or manually with the info below

| Network name        | Gnosis                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **RPC URL**         | [https://1rpc.io/gnosis](https://1rpc.io/gnosis) |
| **Chain ID**        | 100                                              |
| **Currency symbol** | XDAI                                             |

Add xTRAC on MetaMask by importing this contract address

```
0xEddd81E0792E764501AaE206EB432399a0268DB5
```

## Step 2 - Fund your wallet

Begin by obtaining xDAI for operations on Gnosis chain through their [f**aucet**](https://www.gnosisfaucet.com/).&#x20;

Gnosis is EVM compatible. Therefore, you can use your Ledger connected to MetaMask for all operations on the staking dashboard.&#x20;

Once you obtained xDAI, bridge your ERC-20 TRAC from Ethereum to Gnosis by using the [**Omnibridge**](https://omnibridge.gnosischain.com/bridge).

{% hint style="warning" %}
There is no fee for bridging assets to Gnosis other than regular gas fee. However, there is a 0.1% cut on your assets when you bridge assets back to Ethereum from Gnosis.
{% endhint %}

## Step 3 - Stake

{% hint style="info" %}
A node can be fully operational with delegated stake only as long as the total stake amount is 50k TRAC or above. If the node you add your stake to has less than 50k TRAC, it will not be earning any publishes.
{% endhint %}

Visit the [**staking dashboard**](https://dkg.origintrail.io/staking) and connect to your Metamask.

Select the node to delegate your xTRAC.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that delegated stake sent to a node will lock your TRAC for 28 days.&#x20;
