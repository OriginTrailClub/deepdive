# Staking Instructions

{% hint style="info" %}
As of Februrary 2024, delegated staking is live on Gnosis chain mainnet. Delegated staking on NeuroWebAI (formerly known as OriginTrail Parachain) will go live at a later date.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Step 1 - Add Gnosis Network to MetaMask

Begin by adding the Gnosis network to your Metamask extension by either connecting MetaMask to this [**link** ](https://chainlist.org/?search=gnosis)or manually with the info below

| Network name        | Gnosis                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **RPC URL**         | [https://1rpc.io/gnosis](https://1rpc.io/gnosis) |
| **Chain ID**        | 100                                              |
| **Currency symbol** | XDAI                                             |

Add xTRAC on MetaMask by importing this contract address

```
0xEddd81E0792E764501AaE206EB432399a0268DB5
```

## Step 2 - Fund your wallet

Begin by obtaining xDAI for operations on Gnosis chain through their [f**aucet**](https://www.gnosisfaucet.com/).

Gnosis is EVM compatible. Therefore, you can use your Ethereum wallet on MetaMask or Ledger for all operations.

Once you obtained xDAI, bridge your ERC-20 TRAC from Ethereum to Gnosis by using the [**Omnibridge**](https://omnibridge.gnosischain.com/bridge).

{% hint style="info" %}
A node can be fully operational with delegated stake only as long as the total stake amount is 50k TRAC or above.
{% endhint %}

## Step 3 - Stake

Visit the [**staking dashboard**](https://dkg.origintrail.io/staking) and select the node to delegate your xTRAC.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can select [**OTHub**](https://www.othub.io/staking) node for staking to support this open, community driven project that provides network analytics, node statistics and an API to everyone for free.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that delegated stake sent to a node will lock your TRAC for 28 days.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
