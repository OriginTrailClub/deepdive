# Node APR

## What is the OriginTrail Node APR?

I know there's a lot of misconceptions in crypto where staking APR should be a guaranteed number. The reality of it is, it is only known in advance when delegators are paid via a fixed distribution (incentives), or token inflation (value dilution). In other words, staking bonuses that are backed by usually nothing but stimulus checks and promises of utility one day.

This is where OriginTrail's ecosystem stands out from the crowd. The TRAC token is fully distributed and non inflationary.&#x20;

Every TRAC being serviced on the network makes TRAC more valuable and scarce.

Node earnings are completely backed by fully verifiable assets on [http://dkg.origintrail.io](https://t.co/BWCQO6LIDV) and created by real companies, partners, artists or any other retail or institutional participants.&#x20;

#### The factors that can affect node earnings include:

* The amount of nodes on the decentralized network
* The amount of stake on your node
* The relative position of your node
* The relative position of your node to the assets
* The state or status of your node
* The amount of opportunistic assets stored in your node
* The node's ask value
* The amount of assets being created
* The size and duration of the assets being serviced

With that many moving factors, it becomes impossible to provide an accurate node APR. However, [**OTHub**](https://othub.io/) is working on network analytics and statistics for both the DKG network and node runners. Speculatively, the core team behind OriginTrail expect a 100-fold increase in network usage by Q2 2024 and 1 billion assets total in 2025 based on interest by partners, enterprises and government bodies to onboard the DKG.&#x20;

TRAC is a utility token that becomes increasingly valuable as it gets locked up by more assets being created on the network. Market forces and network effects will drive it's value up with more usage.
