# Press & Mentions

## [Web3 and Web 3.0 at OriginTrail](https://www.bobdc.com/blog/origintrail/)

[OriginTrail](https://origintrail.io/) is doing one of the most interesting combinations of blockchain technology and RDF that I have seen. In November I spoke with CTO and co-founder [Branimir Rakić](https://twitter.com/BranaRakic). [Interview by Bob Ducharme](https://twitter.com/bobdc).

[**OriginTrail**](https://origintrail.io/) is a [Decentralized knowledge graph](https://docs.origintrail.io/layer-2-decentralized-knowledge-graph-dkg/dkgintro) that couples and organizes these two worlds together. This way, all these digital items are much more discoverable, verifiable, and thus becoming even more valuable.

Whether or not OriginTrail is the company that succeeds, the shape of a global database seems a very large movement with real momentum. One of the advisors to OriginTrail is **Bob Metcalfe**, the legendary inventor of the Ethernet networking technology that is ubiquitous in computer networks. At an event in Williamsburg, Brooklyn on Tuesday evening sponsored by the company, [Metcalfe told me the approach of the DKG is the future.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ethernet-creator-metcalfe-web3-will-have-all-kinds-of-network-effects/)&#x20;

Decentralized knowledge graphs such as the kind that startup OriginTrail is making will lead to levels of value far greater than has been the case on the internet so far, says Bob Metcalfe.

_“You have to hand it to Tracelabs, the group behind the Origintrail project. The system compensates users for their efforts and serves a vital role in improving business systems. The fact that the network can integrate multiple top-performing blockchains and legacy business systems is another huge plus. These benefits and many others continue to make Origintrail (TRAC) a project to watch in 2022.”_

Our engineering team has utilized the data available from the Bitcoin blockchain and put it in the context of GS1 standards for tracking goods and events and published it on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network. Using the underlying data layer capabilities and graph technology, the team was able to easily aggregate information in the GS1 standardised form, enabling us to do a graph visualization of how the stolen funds are being transferred and to add new, unstructured data to the graph as it becomes available.
