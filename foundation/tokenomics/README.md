## TRAC Utility

OriginTrail TRAC layer-2 token is the life and blood of the entire ecosystem. It is required to perform all operations on the DKG. It is an utility token that drives the entire network:

* **Creating and updating knowledge assets**

Asset creators, such as enterprises, governements and retail, must spend TRAC to compensate decentralized node runners for holding their data for a period of time. This will be the main driver for TRAC’s tokenomics.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="https://dkg.origintrail.io/explore?ual=did:dkg:otp:2043/0x5cAC41237127F94c2D21dAe0b14bFeFa99880630/2838175"><strong>Source</strong></a></p></figcaption></figure>

* **Delegated staking to nodes**

Both node runners and delegators can stake TRAC on their node as a collateral for holding knowledge assets. The more TRAC locked up in a node, the more likely the node is selected to earn TRAC from asset creators. Node runners set an operator fee for staking on their node.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Keyword staking** – Assets owners can lock up TRAC to have their assets prioritized in a search result for a particular keyword, similar to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/). This is akin to a decentralized form of marketing spending in Web3 fashion.
* **Data marketplace** – TRAC as a fungible token under ERC-20 standards is transferable and usable in any way ERC-20 assets are. TRAC can therefore be used in smart contracts that allow TRAC to be used as a compensation token for selling or buying assets. Data creators can earn from ownership of valuable data assets.

NeuroWebAI supercharges these data marketplaces with the addition of **knowledge tokens, knowledge wallets, the knowledge marketplace, and knowledge tenders**. They allow individuals to buy and sell data in a trusted, private way. Because this is tied into to the Polkadot ecosystem, all Polkadot/Kusama projects will be able to utilize this feature. Please see the [2021 Roadmap for a very in-depth look](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-2021-expanded-roadmap-accelerating-growth-through-starfleet-polkadot-and-knowledge-2a1c170daaf3) at this use case.

## NEURO Utility

* **Knowledge Mining**

Refer to the [**Knowledge Mining**](./#knowledge-mining) section below.

* **Gas fees**

NEURO is used as gas fee for transactions, smart contracts and graph contracts (released at a later date) on NeuroWebAI.

* **Incentivizing collators**&#x20;

Collators who perform network functions are required to lock up NEURO to signal the amount of stake they are willing to keep locked for a period of time in order to receive NEURO rewards. The higher the locked amount, the greater the chance a collator candidate gets placed in the group of rewarded collators.

* **Delegate to collators**

NEURO holders who are not collators can delegate their NEURO and earn a part of the reward.

* **Governance and voting**

NEURO holders can lock their NEURO to vote on update proposals for NeuroWebAI and community treasury proposals.

* **Data marketplace**

NEURO as a fungible token, just like TRAC, can be used in a data marketplace environment using smart contracts.

### Knowledge Mining

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (13) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/knowledge-mining-for-decentralized-ai-cac6e7271354"><strong>Source</strong></a></p></figcaption></figure>

Knowledge Mining is a decentralized method to expand the trusted knowledge base for humanity, supported by the NEURO token on NeuroWebAI. This initiative is designed to incentivize the creation of high-quality, blockchain-tracked knowledge assets, with support from the EU's Next Generation Internet initiative and Trace Labs, core developers of OriginTrail.

Key points include:

* The OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) facilitates the creation, discovery, and verification of knowledge assets, with significant adoption by global companies.
* Knowledge Mining encourages the contribution of valuable knowledge to the DKG, rewarding contributors with NEURO tokens and leveraging blockchain technology for data provenance and security.
* The beta Knowledge Mining program, part of the Metcalfe Genesis phase, aims to validate and refine the Knowledge Mining process, with initial focus areas in the OriginTrail ecosystem and the construction industry.
* The transformation of OriginTrail Parachain to NeuroWeb marks a strategic shift towards a blockchain platform dedicated to knowledge-centric functions and Knowledge Mining.
* A community referendum is scheduled to confirm the Knowledge Mining mechanics and the transition to NeuroWeb, with the Genesis Knowledge Mining beta program set to begin in January 2024.

This initiative represents a significant step towards creating a decentralized, global intelligence network, leveraging synergies between blockchain technologies and knowledge graphs to foster a trusted, collaborative knowledge base.
