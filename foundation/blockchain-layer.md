# NeuroWeb AI

{% hint style="success" %}
OriginTrail is an open, decentralized network that doesn't rely on a single blockchain to operate. It is a layer-2 protocol that can be integrated with any chains. \
The core team behind OriginTrail decided to create NeuroWeb AI, a parachain on the Polkadot ecosystem to host the OriginTrail protocol. It is a blockchain using Polkadot's security, flexibility and interoperability to grow the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG).
{% endhint %}

[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), a layer-0 platform, provides a secure and unified ecosystem for specialized blockchains known as parachains. These [parachains](https://parachains.info/) are separate layer-1 blockchains that run alongside each other on the Polkadot network and are connected to the Polkadot Relay Chain, accessible through [auction](https://parachains.info/auctions)-based allocation. Running a parachain on Polkadot offers numerous advantages, including shared security, increased scalability, enhanced interoperability, and collaborative governance. Additionally, the cross-chain composability feature of Polkadot enables seamless transfer of any type of data or asset between parachains, unlocking vast potential for new use cases and applications.

In 2022, the OriginTrail Decentralized Network has adopted a new Blockchain implementation, a Parachain through Polkadot auctions, NeuroWebAI (NEURO). OriginTrail was successful in winning the [**Polkadot Parachain auction slot #17**](https://parachains.info/details/origintrail) in May 2022, and has since then been collaborating closely with the [Parity Technology team, who joined the Trace Alliance](https://medium.com/origintrail/parity-technologies-joins-trace-alliances-working-group-on-decentralization-and-tokenomics-8eaad2843ca7). Additionally, the OriginTrail core development team was chosen for the [the Substrate Builders program](https://www.substrate.io/builders-program/) by Parity Technologies.

The total token supply remains unchanged across different chains. The total supply is fixed at 500M.

OriginTrail combines the power of **Knowledge Graphs** and **Blockchains** to create an open protocol. However, it's important to note that **OriginTrail is not a blockchain** itself; but rather a decentralized network that operates off-chain and in conjunction with the blockchain layer. It has been designed to be interoperable with any blockchain and to act as a complementary middleware solution, addressing the issue of **data interconnectivity**. As a **layer-2 multichain and agnostic protocol**, OriginTrail can be integrated with any blockchain. Currently, the OriginTrail V6 decentralized protocol is live on NeuroWebAI (formally known as OriginTrail Parachain) and Gnosis.
