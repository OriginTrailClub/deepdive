# OriginTrail V8

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Before jumping to the 8th iteration of OriginTrail, let's take a step back and see the natural evolution of OriginTrail from a supply chain data management protocol to becoming the decentralized Internet of humanity for trusted AI.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## OriginTrail V1: The Lunar Orbiter testnet phase

OriginTrail is an open, blockchain agnostic protocol initially designed for trusted data sharing within supply chains, ensuring interoperability through the use of global standards. It offers a decentralized, peer-to-peer network for secure, serverless data storage and exchange with built-in fault tolerance, resistance to DDoS attacks, and tamper-proof safeguards. The network incentivizes participation through the Trace token (TRAC), with the first testnet launch in June 2018.

The protocol categorizes network participants into Data Providers, Data Creator Nodes, Data Holder Nodes, and Data Viewers, each playing a vital role in the ecosystem. Data Providers supply chain data, Data Creator Nodes import and manage this data, Data Holder Nodes store and make it accessible, and Data Viewers request and utilize the data. The system encourages fairness and mitigates collusion through a detailed incentive model, bidding mechanism, and staking system. The introduction of the ERC-725 identity standard enhances node identity verification and interoperability, while updates to the data layer and node resilience optimize performance and reliability.&#x20;
